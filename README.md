# twitter_bot

For my AI course, I was tasked to create a Twitter bot that would tweet messages, making it appear to be intelligent. I would want to create messages so that another Twitter user might consider the bot to be another human user!

For the assignment, I wanted to design a twitter bot that would create a four line verse that rhymed in the form of ABCB. I implemented this program by using the Markovify package, where I drew the context of the sentences from the novel, Heart of Darkness. I also used the Pronouncing package, which allowed me to obtain the rhymes for any word.

Currently, the program runs on an infinite loop, so if you want to stop tweeting, you will have to manually cancel the build.
